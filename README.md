# SimCLRv2 PyTorch
![simclr_anim](https://github.com/kaipak/SimCLRv2-PyTorch/blob/main/images/simclrv2_anim.gif)

A PyTorch implementation of SimCLRv2 architecture developed by Google Research. This code is 
heavily based off [Spijkervet](https://github.com/Spijkervet/SimCLR) SimCLRv1 implementation 
in PyTorch. ResNet architecture and contrastive head are borrowed from 
[Separius'](https://github.com/Separius/SimCLRv2-Pytorch) excellent repo for converting 
Tensorflow weights to PyTorch.
